-- SQL 9 : WINDOW FUNCTIONS
/*
Window functions are also known as analytic functions. Its definiton in the official documents: 

A window function is an SQL function where the input values are taken from a "window" of one or more rows in 
the results set of a SELECT statement.
Window functions are distinguished from other SQL functions by the presence of an OVER clause. If a function 
has an OVER clause, then it is a window function. If it lacks an OVER clause, then it is an ordinary aggregate or
 scalar function. Window functions might also have a FILTER clause in between the function and the OVER clause.

A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. This 
is comparable to the type of calculation that can be done with an aggregate function. But unlike regular aggregate 
functions, use of a window function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row â€” the rows 
retain their separate identities. Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the current 
row of the query result.

To sum up, window functions operate on a set of rows and return a single value for each row from the underlying query. 
This explains "...the rows retain their separate identities." phrase in the definition above. The term "window" describes 
the set of rows on which the function operates. Here is the syntax of the window function:*/

window_function (expression) OVER (
[ PARTITION BY expr_list ]
[ ORDER BY order_list ] [ frame_clause ])

/*
When we use a window function, we simply define the window using the OVER() clause. The OVER() clause separates 
the window functions from other functions in SQL. 
The OVER() clause can take the following clauses to extend its functionality:
- PARTITION BY clause: Defines window partitions to form groups of rows
- ORDER BY clause: Orders rows within a partition
- ROW or RANGE clause: Defines the scope of the function

We can group window functions into three categories:
- Aggregate Window Functions (ANalytic aggregate functions)
- Ranking Window Functions (Analytic navigation functions)
- Value Window Functions (Analytic numbering functions)

*************************************************************************************************
*************************************************************************************************
AGGREGATE Window Functions

An aggregate window function is similar to a normal aggregate function. But the main difference between them 
is the aggregate window function doesn't change the number of rows returned. General syntax:*/
window function (column_name)
OVER ( [ PARTITION BY expr_list ] [ ORDER BY orders_list frame-clause ] )

/*
Window functions syntax breakdown

- window_function: This is an ordinary aggregate function which may be AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM()
- column_name: The column that the function operates on
- OVER:  Specifies the window clauses for the aggregation functions. The OVER clause distinguishes window 
aggregation functions from ordinary aggregation functions.
- PARTITION BY expr_list : Optional. Defines the window for the window function.
- ORDER BY order_list : Optional. Sorts the rows within each partition.
- frame_clause: If ORDER BY clause is used, frame_clause is required. The frame clause refines the set of rows 
in a function's window, including or excluding sets of rows within the ordered result.*/

SELECT graduation, COUNT (id) OVER() as cnt_employee
FROM dbo.department;

--  the whole table records were returned for the graduation column. Besides, the count of employees in the whole table 
-- was written for per row. The new column created with a window function was added into the result without any changes 
-- in the main table. Also, there are many duplicate rows. 

-- ðŸ’¡Tips:
-- If you use DISTINCT keyword like the query below, you would be get rid of duplicate rows.

SELECT DISTINCT graduation, COUNT (id) OVER() as cnt_employee
FROM dbo.department;

-- We didn't use any partitioning, ordering, or frame condition so far. The parentheses near the OVER keyword were empty 
-- and we got the results above.  If we use PARTITION BY with DISTINCT keyword like below:

SELECT DISTINCT graduation, COUNT (id) OVER(PARTITION BY graduation) as cnt_employee
FROM dbo.department; 

-- an example from the store table
SELECT DISTINCT store_id, COUNt(*) OVER(PARTITION BY store_id) as store_IDs 
FROM sale.orders 

-- how many distinct cities from the customers are
SELECT DISTINCT city 
FROM sale.customer

SELECT DISTINCT city, COUNT(city) OVER(PARTITION BY city) as total_customers
FROM sale.customer

-- PARTITION BY specifies partitions on which a window function operates. The window function is applied to 
-- each partition separately and computation restarts for each partition. If we don't include PARTITION BY, 
-- the window function operates on the whole column.

-- What if we use only ORDER BY in the parentheses? 

SELECT hire_date, COUNT (id) OVER(ORDER BY hire_date) cnt_employee
FROM dbo.department;

-- If we don't specify the ordering rule as ASC or DESC, ORDER BY accept ASC by default. So, in this example, hire_date 
-- column was ordered by ascending. 

-- when we don't include the ORDER BY we get total number; when we include ORDER BY then we get running total/cumulative 
-- total. We don't have to use ORDER BY with aggregate window functions. But that's important to know what 
-- happened when you use ORDER BY with aggregate functions.

-- total amount for each order over $500 :

/*
WINDOW FRAMES

By default, a window is set for each row to encompass all the rows from the first to the current row in the partition.
However, this is the default and can be adjusted using the window frame clause. 
A window function query using the window frame clause would look as follows:

SELECT {columns},
{window_func} OVER (PARTITION BY {partition_key} ORDER BY {order_key} {rangeorrows} 
BETWEEN {frame_start} AND {frame_end})
FROM {table1};

Here,
- {columns} are the columns to retrieve from tables for the query,  
- {window_func} is the window function you want to use,  
- {partition_key} is the column or columns you want to partition on,  
- {order_key} is the column or columns you want to order by,  
- {rangeorrows} is either the RANGE keyword or the  ROWS keyword,  
- {frame_start} is a keyword indicating where to start the window frame,  
- {frame_end} is a keyword indicating where to end the window frame


Commonly Used Framing Syntax

			Frame																		Meaning
ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW :	Start at row 1 of the partition and include rows up to the current row.
ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING 						 :	Start at row 1 of the partition and include rows up to the current row.
ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING :	Start at the current row and include rows up to the end of the partition.
ROWS BETWEEN N PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW		 :	Start at a specified number of rows before the current row and 
													include rows up to the current row.
ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND N FOLLOWING		 :  Start at the current row and include rows up to a specified number 
													of rows following the current row.
ROWS BETWEEN N PRECEDING AND N FOLLOWING		 :  Start at a specified number of rows before the current row and 
													include a specified number of rows following the current row. 
													The current row is also included!

/* Ranking Window Functions

Ranking window functions return a ranking value for each row in a partition. Some of the Ranking Window Functions are:

- CUME_DIST	 :   Compute the cumulative distribution of a value in an ordered set of values.
- DENSE_RANK :	Compute the rank for a row in an ordered set of rows with no gaps in rank values.
- NTILE	     :   Divide a result set into a number of buckets as evenly as possible and assign a bucket number to each row.
- PERCENT_RANK :	Calculate the percent rank of each row in an ordered set of rows.
- RANK	     : Assign a rank to each row within the partition of the result set.
- ROW_NUMBER :	Assign a sequential integer starting from one to each row within the current partition.*/

VALUE WINDOW Functions
(Analytic navigation functions)

value window functions allow us to include values from other rows. Value Window Functions access a previous row 
without having to do a self-join. Some also call these functions as 'offset functions'. The following table illustrates 
value window functions and their descriptions. 

Function	Description:

- FIRST_VALUE   : Get the value of the first row in a specified window frame.
- LAG	        : Provide access to a row at a given physical offset that comes before the current row.
- LAST_VALUE	: Get the value of the last row in a specified window frame.
- LEAD          : Provide access to a row at a given physical offset that follows the current row.

 LAG() and LEAD() functions are useful to compare rows to preceding or following rows. LAG returns 
 data from previous rows and LEAD returns data from the following rows. SYntax:

 LAG(column_name [,offset] [,default])
 LEAD(column_name [,offset] [,default])

OFFSET: Optional. It specifies the number of rows back from the current row from which to obtain a value. 
        If not given, the default is 1. In that case, it returns the value of the previous value. 
        If there is no previous row (the current row is the first), then returns NULL. 
        Offset value must be a non-negative integer.

DEFAULT: The value to return when the offset is beyond the scope of the partition. If a default value is not 
        specified, NULL is returned.*/
