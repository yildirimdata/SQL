Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset 

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM attribute;)
ii. Business table = 10000 (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM business;)
iii. Category table = 10000 (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM category;)
iv. Checkin table = 10000 (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM checkin;)
v. elite_years table = 10000 (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM elite_years;)
vi. friend table = 10000 (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM friend;)
vii. hours table = 10000 (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hours;)
viii. photo table = 10000 (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM photo;)
ix. review table = 10000 (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM review;)
x. tip table = 10000 (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tip;)
xi. user table = 10000 (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user;)
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 records for the primary key Id (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM Business;)

ii. Hours = 2052 records for hours fand 1562 records for business_id (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT hours) FROM hours; / SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT business_id) FROM hours;)

iii. Category = 2643 records for business_id and 712 records for category (SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT business_id) FROM category; / SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category) FROM category;)

iv. Attribute = 1115 records for business_id  and 39 records for name (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT business_id) FROM attribute; / SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) FROM attribute;)

v. Review = 10000 records for id primary key (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM review;)

vi. Checkin = 493 records for business_id (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT business_id) FROM checkin;)

vii. Photo = 10000 records for id primary key (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM Photo;)

viii. Tip = 537 records for user_id (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM Tip;)

ix. User = 10000 records for id primary key (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM user;)

x. Friend = 11 records for user_id (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM friend;)

xi. Elite_years = 2780 records for user_id (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM elite_years;)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT id as reviewer_id, name as name, review_count
	FROM user
	ORDER BY review_count DESC
	LIMIT 3;
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
		
+------------------------+--------+--------------+
| reviewer_id            | name   | review_count |

| -8lbUNlXVSoXqaRRiHiSNg | Yuri   |         1339 |
+------------------------+--------+--------------+

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
	When we also add the numbers of fans for these 3 most reviewers, we can see that there is no clear correlation between the review count and the number of fans. Because it can be seen from the table that the reviewer named Sara has less fans then Yuri although Sara has more reviews.
	
	Moreover, when we order the related table in line with the users with most fans, we can see that any of the people in the most reviewer list are not among the users with most fans. As it can be seen, the review counts of users with most fans (Amy, Mimi, Harald) are quite lower than the review counts of the users with most reviews. Related SQL queries and output tables are as follow:

SELECT id as reviewer_id, name as name, review_count, fans
FROM user
ORDER BY review_count DESC
LIMIT 3;
+------------------------+--------+--------------+------+
| reviewer_id            | name   | review_count | fans |

+------------------------+--------+--------------+------+


SELECT id as reviewer_id, name as name, review_count, fans
FROM user
ORDER BY fans DESC
LIMIT 3;

+------------------------+--------+--------------+------+

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:

	There are 1780 reviews which contain "love" word and 232 reviews which contain "hate" word. 

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	SELECT count(text)
	FROM review
	WHERE text LIKE '%love%';

	SELECT count(text)
	FROM review
	WHERE text LIKE '%hate%';
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

I have picked up restaurants from the category and Las Vegas from the cities. The main reason underlying this choice is that the category of restaurants and the city of Las Vegas is the most frequent category and city in the related tables. In order to give a more inclusive insight by analysing the more entries, I aim to use these two features to assess the overall characteristics of the dataset.


	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

My grouping analysis returned 3 restaurants from the city of Las Vegas. Wingstop is in the group of 3 stars and Jacques and Big Wong are in the 4 stars group. All the restaurants open before afternoon (Big Wong at 10.00 a.m. and the others, Wingstop and Jacques at 11.00 a.m. So opening hours is similar. The last two close at 23.00 pm and 00.00 am where the former one closes earlier, at 20.00 pm. Since Jacques and Big Wong with different closing hours take place in the same star group, and Wingstop, which has similar opening and closing hours with Big Wongs takes place in a different star group (3 stars) we can't see a significant difference in terms of the distribution of hours among the star groups.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
 
The number of reviews spreads significantly among the two groups. The group with 3 stars has 123 reviews. On the other hand, the average number of reviews for the 4 stars group is 458. But, this second group also differs in itself significantly. While one of the restaurants has 768 reviews, the other has 168 reviews. In sum, 4 stars group has more reviews than the 3 stars group, but it does not has a homogenous distribution in itself. 
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.


We can do this analysis by using the neighbourhood field. However, the only restaurant in the 3 stars group does not have any information for this field. Therefore we can use a second field, postal_code, to assess the importance of the location. The first restaurant, 

The dataset itself does not provide any information about the main properties of the location, such as the population density, whether the neighborhood is a business area, living area or touristic area,  or where the location is exactly in the city, in the city center or in further part of the city. However, by using postal codes we can get some insights from the online maps such as google map. Such an analysis reveal that the restaurant with the highest number of reviews is located close to the city center. However, the restaurant with the lowest number of reviews is closer to the city center than the second restaurant. So, being close to the city center does not mean a strong and positive relationship in terms of the number of reviews or number of stars.


SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT b.id, b.name, b.city, b. neighborhood, b.postal_code,
        c.category, b.stars, b.review_count, h.hours
	FROM business b
	JOIN category c
	ON b.id = c.business_id
	JOIN hours h
	ON b.id = h.business_id
	WHERE b.city = 'Las Vegas' AND c.category= 'Restaurants'
	ORDER BY b.stars;	
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.

To have a better insight, in addition to the review count and stars, I've also grouped the data according to the different states.
		
i. Difference 1:

Save for MLN and NC, in all states the average number of stars for the business which are still open is higher than the business which are closed.
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
The number of total reviews is higher for the businesses which are still open. This pattern can be seen in all states.      
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT state, is_open, AVG(stars), SUM(review_count)
FROM business
GROUP BY state, is_open;
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

In this part, I will analysis the importance of the reviews and ratings made by the customers for the companies. In our current world, whenever we make decisions, we do a search before this decision by looking to the experiences of other people who used similar services in the related sectors. To explain it more concretely, when people look for a good restaurant to have a dinner with friends or family, when they search a hotel for their holidays, or for a repair service for their autos etc. they highly use the online review portals to make an efficient decision. In this line, reviews and ratings of the customers become very crucial for the companies. Therefore I will analyse the potential effects of the ratings and reviews made by customers on the existence of a business. I will conduct this analysis based on the information about whether the business is still open or closed. This can help the companies in various sectors to understand better the effect of their customers' reviews on digital fields.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

For such an analysis I explained above, I will first classify the businesses to show whether they are still open or already closed. I will use is_open field for this purpose. I will also mainly use the stars and review_count fields to examine the relationship between the customer reviews&ratings and a company's existence. 

Since the economic, social and geographical conditions and characteristics can vary significantly across different states and cities, I will also use state field to detail and deepen my analysis for the local level.

In addition, it would not be proper to deal with all companies in the same pot. Since the businesses in the dataset vary from the tourism sector to the gastronomy or from the automotive sector to the health sector, I will detail my analysis by taking the category field from the category table into account. This will enable my analysis to provide more efficient inferences for each sector and business field.
